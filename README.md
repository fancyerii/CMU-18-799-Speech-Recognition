# CMU-18-799JD-Speech-Recognition
- This is the course provided by JIE (a two year master program from Sun-yet sen University and Carnegie Mellon University)  
- This course introduces speech recognition, including speech signal capture, endpointing, feature extraction, template matching algorithm, HMM, isolated word VS. continuous speech recognition, language modeling and so on.  
- It has six projects, and step by step you will implement a ASR that can recognize telephone numbers from 0 to 9  
- 1. Project 1: Capturing Audio and endpointing
- 2. Project 2: Feature computation
- 3. Project 3: A spellchecker
- 4. Project 4: DTW-based recognition of isolated words
- 5. Project 5: HMM-based recognition of isolated words
- 6. Project 6: Training HMMs from isolated recordings (Viterbi method) & Training (and recognition) of isolated words from continuous recordings
